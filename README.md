# Bitcoin Firewall
World's first implementation of connections firewall & intelligent attack detection

Version 1.2.3 (Core 10) - October 14, 2017

Bitcoin Firewall uses a very unique method for detecting potential hard-fork attacks coupled with specific block chain DDoS flooding. All connected nodes/peers are examined by the amount of data they're sending or receiving regardless of the algorithm or block validity. A deeper analysis is then used to verify their blockchain start & sync height and bandwidth use is within safe limits; The average among all peers connected. Range based blockchain checkpoints that use averages of live blockchain sizes further enhance security by limiting potential attacks known as >51% of distributed hashing power (double-spend, Sybil attack)

# Security Protection
- Average Dynamic Blockheight Checkpoints
- Network Flooding
- Double-Spend & >51% mining attack
- RPC & Configuration
